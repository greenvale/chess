# Chess

This repository containins a backend chessboard system and a gui application that I wrote as a baseline for future chess projects. The gui application is written using wxWidgets. It currently allows for over-the-board play between two people on the same computer.

Future work for this includes a chess AI for playing against the computer and potentially creating a networked application for playing over the internet.
